; Description: Simple array program that contains
; two errors.  This program intentionally has errors.
; One error is a syntax error and the other is a logic error.
; Spelling errors aren't included in the two total errors!
; Code is written based on textbook reading.
; I also referenced W3C schools code on arrays
; https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp
